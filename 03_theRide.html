    <h1>Getting Ready</h1>
    <h5>Day 0 - Baltimore, MD</h5>
    <p>So much has happened leading up to this ride. My motivation for taking on this trip was to gain an experience of a lifetime while promoting a great organization that supports young adults suffering from cancer. My family has been deeply affected by the disease. I never got the chance to know my paternal grandparents; my grandfather and grandmother passed away when I was very young from prostate cancer and lymphoma respectively. At the time, I had no idea what death was. I didn’t understand why “I wouldn’t be able to see my grandparents anymore,” as my parents had told me. Several years later, when my uncle Mike and Aunt Marlene both passed away from cancer, I better understood the emptiness left by the loss of a family member. I only wish I could have had more time to spend with them. Sometimes even the best care cannot save someone struck by cancer. What the Ulman Cancer Fund does is so unique; they fill an unmet need by connecting and inspiring young adults to create a support community of friends and peers.</p>
    <p>As the ride progresses I can only guess what experiences we will have and how our world views will change.</p>
    <p>To share the ride and experiences that we are about to have, I built this website. I wanted to create a better way to interact with our story by building an interactive map that can pull up individual days based on our location. Simply click on the icons above and the blog post will appear.</p>
    <p>Learning to code to create this site was so much fun and is a great skill that I want to carry forward. I learned by googling different keywords and talking to as many knowledgeable people as possible along the way.</p>
    <p>To further support our ride, I have three great sponsors that have donated different items to help outfit me for the ride and add an additional part of the story to this adventure. Mio, a heart rate training company, donated a wrist-based heart rate monitor, clothing, and water bottle! The heart rate monitor will help me monitor my heart rate to get the most out of training.Infinity Saddles, a novel saddle design company, donated an amazing new saddle design. With no break-in period, I have put over 30 hours on the saddle with no pain, only a bit of minor and expected discomfort. These hours include several rides of over 50 miles each, with the longest at 69.9 miles. Microduino donated an electronics setup including a ten degrees of freedom sensor and GPS unit, all on a small and portable footprint to keep track of the route we cover.</p>
    <p>I would not have gotten this far without the incredible donors that have played such a generous role in helping me raise over $5,000 to benefit the Ulman Cancer Fund. I am honestly so thankful for the amazing support I have received from family, friends, and colleagues to make this journey possible.</p>

    <h1>The Beginning of an Adventure for a Lifetime</h1>
    <h5>Day 1 - Baltimore, MD to York, PA</h5>
    <p>And we are off!</p>
    <p>Starting the day at an early 4:30 am, I needed to finish putting on the tires for my ride, fill up on breakfast, and double check that I packed everything I’ll need for the summer. After doing a final run-through, I was ready to head out and start my crazy summer. Leaving my house at 5:30, we arrived at the staging area behind the 4K for Cancer office at 6 am and loaded our bags for the very first time. All packed up, we formed a rag-tag circle and began counting off…”1..2..3..4..5..6..7……….no 8!” After tracking down the missing riders, we recounted all the way to 24. Everyone was here! We grouped up and rolled out of the parking lot to the first stoplight. That’s when we heard it, the first flat of 4K. An alumnus stopped to help and we all set back off to the Baltimore Inner Harbor Amphitheater just 1.5 miles down the road.</p>

    <p>Arriving at the amphitheater, I was totally taken aback by the size of the crowd! So many families and friends came down to support us and see us off. This incredible showing of people was so moving and totally unexpected. Once everyone had a chance to greet one another, we grouped around the center to take team and alumni pictures. Breaking off to the side, we formed our first dedication circle. Holding hands with our left hand up to give support and our right hand down to receive support, we all took turns dedicating our ride to the people for whom we will make this trip. My ride is for my Uncle Mike and Aunt Marlene who both passed away from cancer a few years ago. The friends and family all stepped back from the circle and our 24-person team gathered in the center to begin our cheer, which we only learned the day before. Following in call and repeat fashion:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Where are we from?<br>Baltimore!</p>
      <p>Where are we going?<br>Seattle</p>
      <p>East is?<br>EAST</p>
      <p>West is?<br>SEATTLE</p>
      <p>Who are we?<br>4K!</p>
      <p>Who are we?<br>4K!</p>
      <p>Who are we?<br>4K!!!!!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Riled up and ready to go, we had one final chance to say goodbye. This was probably the most heartfelt goodbye I have ever made in my life. Looking to my brother, parents, aunts, uncle, scoutmaster, and girlfriend, all who came and woke up so early to see us off, I was nearly brought to tears.</p>

    <p>It was finally time to gather our bikes along the harbor and get ready to head towards Seattle! In a line of 120+ riders from edge to edge, we dipped our back wheels into the Atlantic, mounted our bikes, and set off to begin our first ride! With the aid of returning alumni, we went careening down steep roads, spun up short mountains, and practiced calling out road hazards along the way. With ten miles accomplished, we had our first water stop and jammed out to Kanye and took even more selfies. Surprisingly, my old manager Jeff, of Princeton Sports, and new employee Even King (a 4K San Diego alum), rode past and stopped to say hello and wish us luck.</p>

    <p>Leaving the water stop, the next ten miles were uneventful as we turned onto the NCR trail, which would take us the next 60 miles. As we were approaching the lunch stop, I had a painful migraine and began to lapse in and out of focus. I couldn’t remember parts of the trail and my eyes actually closed. Choosing to play it safe, I was shuttled the 8 miles to the lunch stop and unfortunately missed crossing the Mason Dixon Line. Luckily, we took an extra long and well-deserved break before riding again.</p>
    <p>Ready to go, we headed out to finish the last 20 miles. With the surprise help of Matt Leininger, who met us along the route, we blasted through ten miles by turning off the NCR and hopping onto the road. We saw some of the cool local metalwork along the road and the statue at the train station. Splitting back off from Matt’s group, we went back onto the NCR and finished the last ten miles before finally arriving in York, PA at 6 pm! We spent the night at the Downtown Branch YMCA where we got to take clean showers and eat a filling meal of pizza and salad proceeded by an awesome first night of sleeping on a trampoline floor. Craig, the executive director of the York YMCA has happily opened his doors to many 4K Seattle riders over the past 4 years.</p>

    <p>So it began with the words “we made today easier,” proceeded by a soul-crushing nightmare that we still can’t stop laughing about thanks to the many inside jokes that got us through the day.</p>
    <p>We knew today was going to be hard; all the alumni from yesterday kept mentioning the hills and the small number of riders who were able to complete the ride. Apparently only six people were able to finish last year. This year we hit the exact same number with many people in need of a shuttle as night approached.</p>
    <p>Oddly enough, the day started out very normal. Expecting a mountain of epic proportions, I led off with a steady pace around 10 mph and did my best to keep the group together. We climbed up a few hills and sped down the slopes, all keeping a pretty constant roll through PA. A woman stopped her car in an oncoming traffic lane to tell us, “Get off the road,” which was still a much more polite experience than that of a separate team. The other team had a man pull over on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the bridge, roll down his window and shout ASSHOLES,” before quickly driving away. The drivers today were a total mixed bag. Some sped by, crossing lanes and cutting close to us in the shoulder, while others kindly gave us as much clearance as possible.</p>

    <p>Making it through the morning, everyone felt cheery and hopeful that we could finish today. Arriving at a detour, we realized something was wrong with directions. The ground was chalked to have us turn left, so we followed the chalk around the detour. At the time we had been with a second group who decided to wait at the turn to spread out the riding groups. As we climbed up the hills, we kept a strong pace and climbed several hundred feet with descents following the hilly landscape. That was when we hit the mountain. The steep hill was on a busy road with a tiny, crumbling shoulder. Each little summit was hard. Sticking together, once anyone finished, we were jumping up and down cheering the next rider onto the crest of each section. Making it up almost 800 feet in under a mile of distance we reached Mountain Road. Thinking this was the correct Mountain Road; I started cheering everyone onto the top of the hill. Taking a quick rest break we took the right onto mountain road for a steep descent. Three quarters of the way down we were moving at over 30 mph on a smooth, well-paved road. "GRRRBARK," all of a sudden a massive pit bull jolted up and charged towards me. Looking for the faintest hint of a leash, I just kept hoping the dog would stop. With four riders back, someone was in for a terrifying surprise. At the last moment the dog jolted back around as the leash caught. Afterward, several of the riders behind me saw the leash nearly pull straight out of the ground. We couldn't have been luckier.</p>
    <p>Joining back up at the bottom of the hill, we joked about the dogs and tried to figure out where we were. That's when my stomach hit the ground; we were back at the entrance to the detour. We had just come down the detour we had taken a right at two hours before. Bailey talking to Shelby, pointed to her GPS watch:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This line shows where we have been</p>
      <p>This circle is what we just did</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Circling 15+ miles out of our way, we had double backed on ourselves. Knowing that we had just dropped at least 600 feet from where we had been and that the vans couldn't hold all of us, we decided to split into two groups. One group would climb back up to where we made the wrong turn and one would wait for the van's aid. Joining the four riders to reattempt the hill, we sped back up passed the very terrifying dogs and back up to the top of Mountain Road. The others who at first stayed down persevered and made it up the hill not much longer after the first half's ascent. Reaching the top of the hill, we met up with a different group of riders who had the craziest of mechanical problems. Ellie's shifting housing had melted throwing off the adjustment of her rear derailleur and blocking her from using her lowest rear gears. Making it that far without a good gear ratio was so impressive. Ultimately unable to make a sufficient repair, we had to pack up her bike and fix it when we could get parts. Collecting all of the riders at the intersection, we went the next couple of hundred feet to where the right Mountain Road was. Apparently Mountain Road merged with the road we were on and then split off after a couple hundred feet.</p>
    <p>Regrouping at the water van at the very top of the hill, we went one at a time down Mountain Road on a massive downhill. Topping off at 35 mph, while pedaling at full speed, we all reached the bottom in no time. Seeing a quiet side street, I stopped there to regroup the spread out group. Unfortunately only Erin saw me in time, so everyone else grouped up a bit further down the road. Joining the group, it never hit me to check the road we had just passed, which reflecting on what happened, appeared to be Pine Hill road, which we needed to turn onto. Continuing on, we made our way down the rest of the hill to cross a busy intersection. Immediately realizing something was wrong, I brought our cue sheet over and talked to a family out gardening. They were incredibly sweet and helpful and tried to help us with the street names on the cue sheet, but didn't recognize any. They recognized the final destination and gave us some advice of what they thought the cue sheet meant. Following their directions, we came upon a back road that took us North towards the final destination for the night. Having eaten up much of the time left in the day before dark, we headed as quickly through the new route as possible. Emerging onto route 34, we continued our quick pace. Until "phewwww," Mike's tire blew. The whole surface collapsed exposing the sharp metal wound through the tire. Likely a defect, but non-repairable from where we were, we had to call the day to an end and camp out in front of a random person's lawn, while we waited for the van to shuttle us back.</p>
    <p>The van arrived at dusk as we quickly packed up all six riders and bikes and headed out to fetch the last group. Hopping into the van, we had some crazy stories to share from the day from being nearly eaten by bull dogs to the enormous hills and serious of terrible wrong turns and giant circles. Meeting up with the other group, they piled in adding all of their bikes and gear until the van was filled to capacity. They had some of their own ridiculous stories to share. The lawn they ended up on was in front of a work at home taxidermist who let them use his bathroom. After a little while, he walked out saying, "curiosity got the best of me." Bailey hilariously responded with:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Well...you're probably wondering why we are sitting here in your lawn<br/>Good question<br/>We are biking to Seattle<br/>You're probably wondering why we are in New York<br/>Well cause we can...</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Well after dark, we arrived at David's Community Bible Church and quickly passed out for the night after unloading the heavily packed vans. What a second day!</p>

    <h1>One Lucky Ferry Ride and Bike Shop Antics</h1>
    <h5>Day 3 - Millersburg, PA to Selinsgrove, PA</h5>
    <p>Today was easy, relaxing, and well deserved.</p>
    <p>Our day started with a scenic ferry ride across the Susquehanna River. We had decided the night before to take the ferry in order to avoid two nasty bridges with small shoulders and fast cars. The ferry ride also cut 21 miles out of the ride! Anticipating an easy day, we slept in until a staggering 8:30 am…. needless to say that was the longest and best sleep I’ve had in weeks. After waking up, we split into groups and rode the 8 blocks to the ferry, singing, “I’m on a Boat” the whole way there.</p>
    <p>Once on the ferry, we proceeded to take tons of selfies, take in the sights, and take a genuine chance to bond as a team and tell our own stories. After crossing the river and arriving at a small series of campsites, we climbed up to the road, turned out onto the highway shoulder, and rode the last twenty miles to Susquehanna University. Although the ride was relatively flat and boring, we had the opportunity to ride side-by-side and just chat, which led to some great conversations. We made it to the University at 1:30 pm, unlike yesterday when we arrived at 10:30 pm. With all the extra time, we headed out to a local bike shop to fix up Ellie’s bike, which had been beaten up from a small accident. At the shop, I had the opportunity to work with Ryland (I‘m not sure of the spelling, so I hope this is right) and learn so many little tricks and tips for working on bottom brackets with external cups. He then proceeded to guide me through the whole process! With the help of John and Ryland, Ellie’s bike was up and working in no time. A big thank you goes out to Earl’s Bike Shop!</p>
    <p>This is where the funny part of the story starts. So, on our way to the bike shop, Google maps directed us to a closed building. Confused, we decided to give the bike shop a call. I typed “Earls Bike Shop Louisburg” into my phone and waited for the results to pop-up. Go ahead, search it: Google Search. Did you see it? Well I didn’t… I clicked over to the company’s contact info and dialed their number. Reaching the bike shop, I quickly introduced myself and explained how we were unable to find them. The employee gave us some directions and we continued with our search. Feeling lost again, we called back. This time we explained where we were. I mentioned Peking Garden House and Ellie noticed a Sherwin Williams Paint Store. While he didn’t recognize the restaurant, he immediately recognized the Sherwin Williams store and quickly asked if we were near a car dealership, which happened to be right across the street. He then realized “where we were” and told us the large road was actually Iowa Street and that we should take a:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Left on Woburn<br/>Left on Alabama until the road ends<br/>Right on Cornwall<br/>Right on Meridian<br/>And we would find them on the corner of Meridian and Louisiana</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>He also mentioned a Walmart and Target followed by a bridge right before the turn onto Woburn. As these seemed to be reasonable directions, we set off to the shop. About 15 minutes in, something felt very wrong, sort of a pit-in-the-stomach sensation. We pulled up the map and began searching for Woburn. Based on our location and the directions given by the bike shop, there was no way Woburn Street was nearby. The Susquehanna River ran parallel to the road, meaning our directions would have put us in the middle of the river! I decided to start from scratch and pull the address back up. Once again, we were routed to Peking Garden house. Confused, I checked the contact information to make sure everything was correct and that’s when I realized...</p>
    <p>EARL’S BIKE SHOP WAS IN WASHINGTON STATE!?!?!</p>
    <p>Luckily we were only 20 minutes out of the way. This was definitely one of the funniest and most ridiculous things I’ve ever done. It turns out that I typed in Louisburg rather than Lewisburg! It’s crazy that the series of events worked out so perfectly and that we were able to find the correct bike shop, which we ironically missed by just one street on our first attempt. Needless to say, once we arrived at the bike shop, everything ran smoothly and we were able to get the bikes up and running.</p>
    <p>We spent the rest of the evening eating with our very gracious hosts at Susquehanna University, an alumnus (who had a pedal failure and still managed to bike two miles), and a 4K and ironman teammate. This was our first home cooked meal and everything was delicious. We had an amazing venison dish along with plenty of lasagna with both vegetarian and meat loving options.</p>
    <p>After dinner we reconvened for the most moving and emotional part of the trip thus far. I was tearing up the entire time. We gathered in a circle in the dorm lobby and formed a powwow. We made jokes for a while before settling in to discuss the previous day and feelings about the trip. The most moving part began when some of my teammates shared their stories about cancer and losing loved ones. I am tearing up now as I write this, their stories were just so impactful and really brought to light the brutality of cancer. From sisters to mothers, best friends to little children, every story was heartbreaking. Some of my teammates have faced and overcome immense adversity and it is amazing to be here and ride with them for such a great cause. We suffer through the hills and ascend the peaks to prove that we can make it over any obstacle as a team. Our mission is to support those suffering from this terrible disease. For those who are going through cancer alone, the Ulman Cancer Fund puts together a network of support so the patient can play sports, talk about dating and life, and form friendships. These patient navigators work with families to ameliorate their cancer experience by providing support, treatment information, and companionship. The cancer process is an uphill battle that nobody should have to fight on his or her own.</p>

    <h1>Cows and Hills!</h1>
    <h5>Day 4 - Selinsgrove, PA to Mansfield, PA</h5>
    <p>Pennsylvania definitely has hills.</p>
    <p>Today started out very steady. My ride group included Jaya, Evan, and one of our ride directors, Shelby. Maintaining a solid pace of about 13 mph, we knocked out the first 8 miles after rising at 4:30 am and leaving a spotless university dorm three hours later. That was when our first major technical issue arose. Matt’s derailleur was  broken. Trying to be optimistic, I had hoped that the derailleur was fine and only the hanger was broken. We decided to call one of the vans to bring up an extra bike. While the vans were on their way, we had a fun hour to play games. Matt started the first game called “doobie doobie doobie.” The game starts with one person saying a short sentence, but only the last word is important (i.e. “my name is Matt and I ride bikes“). The next person then creates a new sentence that has the last word rhyme with the last word of the previous sentence. So the next person might be: “When I bike I am in pain.“ My rhyme was so bad, “I hate cats….” but Erin had an even better one, “ohhhohhhaaawwwhhhhh bats.” After a few rounds of laughing, we finally worked up the energy to play two quick rounds of Ninja.</p>
    <p>Once the vans arrived, I switched Mike’s derailleur hanger onto Matt’s bike, but to no avail. The derailleur was still askew. We made a few calls and located a pair of derailleurs stocked up in the back of the lunch van. Breezing through the repair, I opened up the chain, pulled the old bent part out, and slapped on the new derailleur and reassembled the chain. Running the shifting cable taught in the lowest gear, I quickly dialed in the shifter and made the quick barrel adjustment to make it all work. Doing a final check over, I noticed a consistent clicking noise, which turned out to be a kinked link. I immediately felt a sinking feeling in my stomach; I had seen this problem a million times before at the bike shop and I had yet to find a solution. The only thing left to do was just rummage through the toolbox in despair. Pulling together some Teflon chain lube and pliers, an idea started to hatch. Hoping to get the chain working again, I added lube and began working it into the chain with the pliers. Without luck, the chain was still forming a stiff triangle when it should be straight. Attacking it again with a new approach, I thought about why the chain was kinked. This time I decided to open up the outer part of the chain to give more space for the inner part of the chain to move freely. It worked!!! The chain went slack and straightened out. I didn’t realize at first, but after a few times of spinning the gears, the noise was gone! A few moments later, everything went back into the cars.</p>
    <p>Repaired, rested and ready to go, we chewed up 25 miles of hills, mountains, and flats, rocking a steady pace of 12.6 mph. Some of the hills were huge, they literally looked like mountains in the distance, which they likely were. Ilana had the tip of the day to change the way we rode a downhill section. Instead of coasting down long downhill sections, she suggested to shift up and pedal down the hills then to shift down and continue the same pedaling cadence on our way up the following hill. This made a huge difference as we peaked at 40.1 mph downhill and shot straight up 2/3 - 3/4 of each following hill keeping a good pace. The rolling hills were so much fun, and besides the long technical repair, we were making amazing progress...until we hit construction. Six miles of construction closed down the shoulder and kept the five lanes of speeding traffic down to just two with no shoulder. For everyone’s safety, we decided to shuttle the bikers past the construction work and to a parking lot up the road. From there it was a downhill that put us right back on track. Before making the six-mile trek through traffic, we had lunch; we ate an amazing helping of Burger King and McDonalds. Whoppers, big macs, and fries were a great way to pack in the calories for the rest of the evening. Although the spot was under just a little bit of shade on a concrete pad, I fell asleep so quickly after stuffing down three sandwiches, fries, and a juice box. Waking up about an hour or two later, I was quickly caught up to speed on what had happened. After finishing up lunch, the first group packed up and set off in the shuttle. About an hour later they returned to take the next group, which took another 45 minutes or so. The delay was due to the roof rack on the shuttle. It was time consuming and difficult to get the bikes on and off. So, when I woke up, the group decided to take the last two teams at once to cut down on time, as it was already 4:30 pm. We moved all twelve bikes onto the roof, filling every available spot. We then dashed to reorganize the internal layout of the van to leave enough room to fit 8 people. It was a tough fit. Once everyone was in, it became clear that we were running out of time. Although we all wished to complete the whole day’s ride, we needed to arrive before sunset at 8:34 pm, as we have no night riding equipment and these mountains would be dangerous at night. So, we moved up to a further drop off point than the previous groups. We were dropped off at a small farm where the drive was wide enough to unload the bikes. From this point, we only had 35 miles to go.</p>
    <p>To our surprise, as soon as we pulled up into the yard, the most adorable Labrador named Lina assaulted us. We then met the sweetest family who owned the farm. The mom came out to greet us with her youngest daughter in her arms and talked with us for a little bit about life on a farm while we exchanged stories about 4K and what we were doing. Meanwhile, half the group was playing with the lab by rubbing her belly and playing with her face and ears to get her riled up. [On a side note, one of my best friends thinks of me as a puppy and today, some of the other riders in the group commented that they were seeing two puppies playing - guess I live up to the nickname]. The mom then took us on tour of her barn and brought us out into this clearing that opened up into an outdoor portion with two baby cows. Peppermint was only 3 weeks old! The two cows, Debbie and Peppermint were both relaxing in the hay and were quite startled by our presence. Carefully edging up along the fence line, I sat out in the rocks, making sure Debbie felt comfortable, and waited for her to come to me. After a few minutes, Debbie’s curiosity got the best of her and she came in to sniff me and licked my leg. It was probably the most exciting experience I’ve had since volunteering at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore! It is always so amazing to see such a giant animal be so inquisitive and shy. Finally ready to set out, we said our goodbyes and were about to head out when a school bus pulled up. Lina quickly scampered up into the school bus before anyone could hop out. What a dog!</p>
    <p>Setting off again, we were at the base of a giant hill and we pedaled as hard and as fast as we could and quickly ascended another mile. Reaching the top of this section and taking a break due to a spill, I took the opportunity to call our contact at 4K for Cancer to update them on the consistent mechanical issues we were seeing so they could relay the information to other teams using the same bikes. While on the phone, the van rolled up and relayed new changes in the itinerary. The Mansfield mayor would be at the picnic at 7 pm and we would need to arrive at 8 pm to be able to shower. As it was running so late and a storm was brewing, we decided that it would be unsafe to continue biking and we decided to shuttle everyone to the church. When we thought everything was going well, the spotty reception diminished our progress. One vehicle went 40 miles in the wrong direction and then had to turn around to rescue one of the two stranded teams. By 9 pm, everyone finally arrived, safe and sound, hungry and sweaty. The local Mansfield University facilities stayed open a little late to allow for the last minute returners to hop into the shower and get cleaned up. Once cleaned, everyone reconvened at the church to enjoy the amazing picnic the community had prepared. It is truly so amazing to see how genuinely helpful and willing people are to open their doors to some of the smelliest college bikers about. We couldn’t do it without their support.</p>

    <h1>Quarries and Leaving PA!</h1>
    <h5>Day 5 - Mansfield, PA to Ithaca, NY</h5>
    <p>I was so ready to ride today. Up and packed in just ten minutes, I had my bag out first and bike soon after. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise of yogurt thanks to our generous hosts! A sweet treat compared to the grain-heavy diet we had gotten used to. The mayor, who had met us the night before, came back to join our dedication circle along with a local schoolteacher and his son who stopped to join the circle on their way to school.</p>

    <p>The morning ride was  gorgeous. We rode out of Mansfield and through some of the prettiest parts of Pennsylvania. Starting off a bit chilly we had to bundle up in the morning, but the sun came out and quickly warmed us up. One really cool part of the ride brought us down onto a gravel road where we joined a second group and made our way to the first water break. Eager to explore, I kept trying to ride until losing total control and watch the soft ground slide out from under me. Forgetting that I was on a  road bike, the sand got the better of me and swallowed my front wheel, dropping me off the bike. Oops! But for the first fall I've ever had on a road bike, I couldn't have picked a softer landing spot. Getting back on, Natalie and I rode the rest of the way up the rocky hill and peaked up over the crest and found a sand and rock quarry!</p>

    <p>Moving on from the morning snack, we continued onto a really cool downhill section. This was a monster downhill. So stoked to get some speed, I led the group down, taking the straightaways as fast I could and slowing up into the turns, cutting wider than normal to keep as much of a sight line as possible. Blasting down through the final straightaway and out of the trees, two cars suddenly came up on me. Frantically pointing to myself, holding up three fingers and then pointing behind me, I hoped to alert the drivers to the three riders behind me. Reaching the next turn, I stopped to regroup. Watching each rider come out of the final straightaway was hilarious, from plastered smiles to confused expressions of fear and happiness; our group had gone so fast down that hill. Surprisingly, the drivers who I had seen going up actually took it slow. Each rider coming down was surprised by how slow the climbing drivers were going; it’s nice to know some drivers make an effort to be cautious.</p>

    <p>But we weren't done with downhill sections for the day. Turning onto a massive highway, we biked in the wide shoulder. Seeing signs for a 2.5-mile downhill warning for truckers to downshift, I knew we were in for a bit of fun. Sprinting ahead I shifted into my biggest gear and smashed away at my cranks. Cranking up to only 35 mph, I descended the hill in less than 4 minutes. Yup, it was just as awesome as it sounds. After what felt like a never-ending descent, the hill finally merged with a new road right at the base. Pulling up across the merge, I stopped to signal to the next riders that the merge lane was clear.</p>

    <p>Of course, what would a huge downhill be without the huge uphill afterward....</p>
    <p>Biking through rustic and cozy downtown Ithaca, we took in all the views. Wrapping around the high school, we came upon a road that disappeared into the mountain. We all knew what we were about to face. </p>
    <p>Cheering each other on and taking it one ascent at a time, we finally emerged for the last quarter mile before rolling into the Vineyard Church for a warm Chipotle dinner! We made it!!</p>
    <p>Joined by 4K alumni, Lindsey Shulock, I learned a lot about previous rides and received plenty of advice. She biked Seattle in 2012 and completed the run in 2013. While she wanted to join us again this year, she wasn’t able to fit it in. As Lindsay passed on her fun stories, she told of the typical watermelon story every team had. Somewhere in the West, each team was bound to have an entire watermelon but no knife. I guess we’ll have to get creative figuring out how to open ours up! Like me, Lindsay had not known many people affected by cancer coming into the ride. However, I was really grounded by her heartfelt stories of why she rode and of the people she met.</p>
    <p>Ready to relax, we re-discovered who in the group could give massages and celebrated Lauren's birthday, complete with cake, candles, and hats! This quote had to be shared:</p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>My first fall on the sand was nice and soft; unfortunately I wasn't so lucky with my second fall.</p>
    <p>Circling back to ride up one of the hills with a teammate, I took the U-turn too fast and ended up in the gravel on the shoulder. With my front wheel-sliding out, my bike  dropped me onto the ground and gave me a small scrape to prove it.</p>

    <h1>Bike Maintenance</h1>
    <h5>Day 6 - Ithaca, NY Service Day</h5>
    <p>Today started at a leisurely 8:30 am to a warm breakfast prepared by hosts. Our hosts for our first service day were so great to us. Eggs never tasted so good or were ever so filling. We met after breakfast and split up chores. We had a little time to do the maintenance that keeps our vans and bikes clean as we had been biking all the time, so we used the time to clean up and reorganize. After the morning's cleaning, the van sparkles when you look at it from the right direction.</p>
    <p>Being the mechanic, I do bikes 24/7. I had everyone bring his or her bike to the “bike shop” and sign each one with a permanent  marker to create an inventory system. I then ran through a quick checkup on each bike to make sure nothing was loose. Handing the bike over to Kevin, he took care of all the brakes and made sure they were all tight and safe, as I had noticed an unsettling issue with improper bolt tension. After the bike checked out, the bike was moved to a completed pile. Some bikes had more technical repairs or I wanted to use as demo bikes, so those were put aside for later that night. All 24 bikes were checked out in about an hour and a half, if not for Kevin and then Natalie and Eric helping out, I could have easily been there for two hours. Besides, I was excited to see other riders interested in learning more about bike repair and practicing their skills.</p>
    <p>For fun, I kept a tally of the most common repairs that I needed to do. Here are the final numbers:</p>

    <p>Working on bikes made me hungry, so I ate a half pizza and Chipotle burrito--thank goodness we burn 4,000 (4K) calories a day!</p>
    <p>After lunch, we set out to downtown Ithaca and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BikeRackIthaca">Bike Rack</a>. They promptly serviced the three bikes that we brought and a wheel. Done at 4 pm and far earlier than the 5:30 time that they expected, we were well on our way all for a reasonable price. In the shop, Garry, Danny, and Kevin helped get the bikes set and were very helpful in explaining what went wrong and how to fix the problems in the future. They even were kind enough to donate a pedal wrench to help us avoid any stripped pedals. I couldn’t be more thankful for their generosity!</p>
    <p>After the bike shop, we went to the base of the waterfall and hung out by a small stream as a whole team and took in the calmness after some people explored some mud paths. Packing up into the vans, we headed into Downtown Ithaca to find lunch and to further explore the city. My group headed to Collegetown Bagels. They were really excited to meet us and hear about what we were doing. They even took a picture of us at the store! I was totally amazed by the chalk art that was their menu. The shading and drawing was so intricate. Each item even had its own typeface. Apparently two traveling artists take care of the signage and the art in the background. Here are a few photos to see!</p>

    <p>After lunch, Eric invited Ilana and I to dinner with his aunt and uncle who lived in the area. They took us out to this amazing little Mediterranean restaurant, Sahara Mediterranean Restaurant, that had some of the best baba ghanoush, libnah and tabouli. The swordfish was also amazing. I ordered a beef shawarma, which just hit the spot. Eric's Aunt and Uncle were really sweet and interesting. We all had a great conversation and we learned more about Eric's aspirations to produce a documentary. Eric wants to share what no other 4K rider has succeeded in doing, documenting the trip. Six other attempts have all fallen flat. Filming is work and just takes away from the fun of the trip, but it also just difficult to turn all of the hours of film into a compelling story. I’m excited to see what he turns out from this project! Learn more about it <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/4000-miles-for-cancer">here</a>.</p>
    <p>After dinner, we were taken on a very special tour of Ithaca by Eric’s aunt and uncle who showed us the lake, which we totally missed on our way in and then around to the waterfall, which we would have really missed otherwise. Here are photos:</p>

    <p>After taking a nice break to jump in and swim in the lake, we continued on the ride. Making our way up and around a few more hills, I totally lost track of where I was again. Before I knew it I caught a glimpse of my bike turning into the street. Overcompensating, I tried to right the bike back to the shoulder, but everything seemed so slow. The next thing I knew, I woke up, still straddling my bike, but clipped out and facing the opposite direction we had come. The riders in my group had all stopped and grouped around me. They had called for and had a van to come and pick me up. Before I knew it I was asleep in the back of the van on my way to the host.</p>
    <p>The next few hours were kind of a blur. I remember arriving at the host and helping unload stuff as people made their way in, but at some point I completely passed out on my duffel--too tired to unpack my sleeping pad from it.</p>

    <p>Waking up again when it was dark, most of the team was out doing laundry and some had gone to a Relay for Life event somewhere nearby, so the church was really quiet. Alert and awake after such a long nap, I wandered the church and found a few other people. Hearing the characteristic boom of fireworks we all made our way outside for a firework show just visible over the trees.</p>
    <p>Bouncing around to do a few things, I ended up giving Jess a hand with her wheel. After 13 flats from day 1, something was definitely wrong with the wheel. Peeling off the low quality plastic rim tape, I noticed the weird shape of the rim holes for the nipples that held the spokes in place. Without the proper cotton rim tape to replace the plastic rim tape, we made do with the duct tape from the mechanic kit and set to work to cover each hole.</p>
    <p>Luckily it worked!! (Spoiler: Jess went from multiple flats a day to only one a few days later)</p>

    <p>Today was going to be a great day. Let me rephrase that, an AWESOME day. I mean what kind of day starts when you are politely asked to finish off the last donut. Yes please! But then it kept getting better. As the last group, we turned to start picking up our bikes only to catch the breeze as Jess sprinted past us to go pet a pug walking around the corner. What a puppy! Yoda the pug and mini, a terrier, who was super shy took our attention for the next few minutes.</p>
    <p>Now with our puppy quota for the day, we set off. The rest of the day was really fun. We stopped at the first water stop to show off how gangster we were and then stopped at an automotive repair shop to help loosen Ellie's stripped seat post bolt.</p>

    <p>That was until we found this random bridge that just sort of emerged from the grass field. Instantly curious, I jutted off the trail and carefully biked up the loose rock slope. Making it to the top I circled back down to take a picture and just so happened to meet one of the two volunteers who helped put the bridge here. Stopping to tell us his story, Bill Laughton, he had helped reshape this park into one of the best parks along the Erie Canal. The bridge had a long history from when it was Clinton's ditch and before it was straightened and widened to become the Erie Canal of today. While the project opened up the river, the bridge had to go and was sold to a farmer down the road. Falling into disrepair, one flood actually ripped the bridge out and essentially destroyed it. So they repaired and rebuilt the bridge to return it here; now a site of weddings and local rides.</p>

    <p>As Bill left another rider pulled up. Larry! Part of the MS ride, Larry was with a group very similar to our own to bike across the country for MS. Following a similar route to us, he was biking through NY to their host for the night. Heading the same way we rode together for a little bit before he returned back to the trail. But after a quick nap, Larry caught back up and rode with us some more. We greatly enjoyed the company and were happy to have another rider with us.</p>
    <p>This was all of course before lunch. Which happened to be atop a huge hill, but with pizzas, yogurt, and a side of Snickers.</p>
    <p>Arriving in the city we decided to explore and have some fun. We took an extra turn down the main stretch to see the main city and emerged in the heart of the small town at this cool fountain. It was a large round with plenty of people around and just perfect for trying to ride through. Coming back to the host, we even found a firehouse and had a chance to meet Desmond, who happily took us on a tour through the firehouse before heading out to respond to a call. At the firehouse we met up with Larry's compatriot's Kevin, Joe, and Max, more of ride MS.</p>

    <h1>First Time Going to the ER</h1>
    <h5>Day 9 - Rochester, NY to Buffalo, NY</h5>
    <p>Today was frustrating.</p>
    <p>The morning started out fine. I woke up and kept trying to get mail to send the pile of emails that were sitting in my outbox, as I continued to pack up. Bringing all my stuff outside, I pulled out the bike stand and made the repairs I needed to on my road bike. I loosened the H limit screw on the front derailleur and tightened up the cable to reduce the rubbing of the derailleur on the chain. I also tightened down my headset and my water bottle cages as they both were rattling and coming loose. Working on my bike, I realized that I had never taken the time to finish up the repair on Jackie's bike, so I went over and loosened up her stem and fork to re-tighten them to a better fit. Pumping up my tires, I walked around and helped with a few teammates making adjustments or doing repairs before heading inside to grab breakfast.</p>
    <p>Taking a just washed bowl from Evan I piled it high with raisin bran and milk. Wolfing down the first bowl, I went for second and then a third, which consisted mostly of just ground up cereal at that point. Gathering everyone up, we all went outside for our dedication circle inviting the sisters of the convent and a passerby who had made a very generous donation that morning.</p>
    <p>Ready to head out, the last few items were thrown into the water van and it left to chalk the beginning portion of the route. Falling into a group with Eric, Jaya, Dana, and Rachael we broke back up again to make sure all of our bikes were ready and that everyone had sunscreen. Three members of my team had to use a restroom so they went back inside. Meanwhile, Dana and I were sitting and watching as group after group left. Almost the last two left, we snuck out to just out of sight following the second to last group.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <P>KYYYLLEEEEE</P>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Eric, Rachel, and Jaya finally emerged around the corner totally confused. Everyone was gone; the lot was completely empty. Feeling left behind they kept biking to catch up with the last group, as Dana and I emerged from the hiding spot giggling.</p>

    <p>Biking across the bridge and then down onto a scenic trail along the Genesee river, it wasn't long until we were lost. “Team Lost” had gotten turned around again and biked back across the bridge to cut in front of us. Meeting each other again in front of a part of the trail that turned into sidewalk, team lost was lost again. Being team follow we just kept following up to a large map. Figuring out north based on the sun and then comparing the cue sheet with the map, we figured we were heading the right way. Ready to set off again, we quickly hit a snafu. The construction project on a building there blocked part of the trail. Not wanting to take the detour out of the way across the other side of the river, we hopped into the street and biked down three blocks around the construction and then cut through some grass until we emerged onto the bike path again.</p>
    <p>Going forward another mile to bring our total to 2…. we had another closed portion of trail. This time there was no reroute around this construction. Instead of listening to the cue sheet, we used Google maps and rerouted to the next step on the sheet and followed the directions along a busy road. Finally back on route we pushed through along Scottsville looking for Paul St. The very calm and aware Dana helped Google map the new route and took over directions over the 2-mile stretch to get to the next direction on the cue sheet. We saw more chalk seeing we had indeed returned to the route. Now at only ten miles, we packed back into two separate groups and continued along Paul Road talking most of the way.</p>
    <p>The route had a few big hills and some sweeping downhill sections, so we began to ride on our own and couldn't talk as much. Feeling the headache pain and dizziness set in, I took a quick break to lie down. Not ready, but as good as it would be, we set off again, until Rachel had a bee land on her leg, which I brushed off with a apple juice container found in the recycling bin next to us.</p>
    <p>Making it to the water stop, I knew I couldn't go any farther without risking my own life or the group as I had been swerving for portions of the road behind us already. Calling it a day at 20 miles, we decided to try to find a medical clinic in buffalo to figure out what I was going to do for the rest of the trip.</p>
    <p>Reorganizing the van for space for myself, I quickly fell asleep through much of the rest of the afternoon.</p>

    <p>The rest of the day was sort of a blur. We arrived at Jake's house and began setting up tents in the backyard for the night. Jake's mom immediately recognized my symptoms and suggested I go straight to the WNY immediate care. Then came a string of doctors and technicians. The first receptionist was extremely nice and made my day a little better (good luck to her at dental school). Then I was rushed off to a hospital for better diagnostics. There we met a security guard who regaled us with stories from when he traveled the nation three times by car further helping make the day a little less intense.</p>
    <p>So after what had turned into hours of being visited intermittently by doctors and technicians, we finally got a diagnosis. I had most definitely suffered a concussion and was begging to experience post concussion disorder. They suggested I stop biking and go home if possible. Hoping to stay with the ride in a different role, I was optimistic of being in the vans the rest of the trip. Released from the hospital we made our way back to Jake's and arrived at 1 am. I couldn't be happier with the trio that kept me laughing through the whole experience, Ellie, Natalie and Chey (who had my baby).</p>

    <p>Can I just say how good pancakes are? I must have been talking about two days ago how much I missed pancakes and the Pandolfini's must have heard because they cooked up a very filling and delicious breakfast. Everyone was worried and kept checking in on me today after my ER visit last night, but were relieved that I was committed to staying with the trip.</p>
    <p>Then came the most exciting part of the day. As we had biked North since leaving Baltimore, we had arrived at Niagara Falls! I couldn't believe my eyes. Niagara Falls looks big from a distance but getting closer, I realized just how big it was.</p>

    <p>After Niagara Falls we headed to the nearby Hope Lodge to serve dinner. I could barely stay awake and was practically falling asleep standing. With all twenty-four riders more than enough to serve the meal, I was placed in the van to sleep. Waking up hours later, we met Kate, who has an incredible story and was awarded a $2,500 scholarship through the Ulman Cancer Fund. This is where the fundraising that we put together can go. With everything we raised, students like Kate can get through and succeed at college! After enjoying a fun picnic with Kate and the Pandolfini's (our hosts), we went back to a quick poolside meeting and soon after to fall asleep in our tents.</p>

    <h1>First Van Duty</h1>
    <h5>Day 11 - Buffalo, NY to Erie, PA</h5>
    <p>I'm a hard sleeper after a concussion. Finally woken fifteen minutes after everyone else, I get my stuff together and caught up with everyone. After a quick breakfast, I helped pack up the van and made sure it was neat, since I would be in it all day. As we put the last bike on, Elli was on the back of the truck and just disappeared from view. All I heard was a sheer scream. Jumping down, Ellie was flat out on her back clutching her ankle. Stepping off the van she had stepped unevenly onto a water container that was just behind her and she had reinjured her left ankle. Getting her some ice was about all we could do. Whatever Ellie was made of was some tough stuff because she shook off the duplexed injury and hopped into the van. As she couldn’t drive, Chey joined us in the van to drive.</p>
    <p>The day was wet and rainy, so we did our best to chalk each direction. Marking three bold, clip-art arrows at each turn, I jumped back into the van to stay ahead of the team. We had another sick rider and went back to pick him up and then set up the first water stop when we caught back up to the first group. Several more riders weren't feeling too great as the day progressed, so we got anyone who was sick to the hotel for the night as we finished chalking.</p>
    <p>While driving back and checking in on the riders, I decided it would be a good time to check pedal tension. Going from bike to bike, I found at least half the bikes I was looking at were poorly adjusted and one was downright loose. Tightening them all up, I came to the last one. It was an awkward angle, but I figured I would just get it done really quickly without a problem. “Bunf,” my hand slipped with the wrench; it went up and straight into the chain ring tearing up three of my fingers. Dripping with blood, the cut was deep. With nothing in the van to clean the wound effectively, I stopped by one of the nearby homes. A family on their yard happily opened up their doors and shared some peroxide, which saved my finger, but left me with a wicked scar on the backside of my left ring finger in the middle section (<a href=“http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9rWBOPzzfbI/TPY9kq0zh7I/AAAAAAAAABk/fsT1_avhmb8/s1600/finger-names.jpg”>on the middle phalanx</a> ).  I came out of the incident pretty unscathed and not kidnapped. Fixing bikes with limited tools on the side of a highway is tough work.</p>
    <p>Circling back we supported the final group of riders as they tried to finish the first century day! With a storm looming in the horizon, we were up against nature to get everyone safely to the hotel. A large chunk of the team was able to finish or get veryveryvery close! It is an awesome achievement to ride that far and I'm so proud of everyone who made it.</p>

    <h1>Nothing Like a Home-Cooked Dinner</h1>
    <h5>Day 12 - Erie, PA to Cleveland, OH</h5>
    <p>The hotel continental breakfast was surisingly delicious. I loaded up on yogurt (a rariety on 4K), scones and several danish pastries.</p>
    <p>Taking a novel approach today we split up in the morning. Our team was tired and sick, so we made the tough decision to shuttle the first half of the ride. The first group headed out and was put in at mile 40. The second group called up restaurants, sorted through food and prioritized what would spoil first to load the food van to get lunch, and repaired and cleaned bikes to get ready to ride. When the van returned, we caught up with the lead group and had lunch. Unfortunately, some complaints forced us to leave and pack up lunch early.</p>
    <p>Finishing at Ellie's grandparent's house, we had a wonderful home cooked dinner with a great family. </p>

    <h1>The Worst Day Ever</h1>
    <h5>Day 13 - Cleveland, OH to Sandusky, OH</h5>
    <p>I woke up with one of the worst headaches I had in a long time. That is after I was finally shaken awake. I was even harder to wake then I had been earlier in the week and it was consistently getting worse since my concussion. As I was also fighting off a cold, I wouldn't be able to help on the service at the hope lodge that morning, so I had to stay back at Ellie's grandparent's house and do what else I could for the team. During the time, the other sick riders and I called restaurants and sought food donations for the day. We had some success and it paid off for a HUGE lunch that afternoon.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="large-6 columns">
    <p>Further attempting to pass the time and to be helpful, me made more repairs of some bikes and I organized gear to make repairs once the rest of the team returned. Poor Rachael was just getting back from being sick and was back to riding, but her bike had been on top of the van and had nearly rusted solid. I worked at it for as long as I could to get what surface rust had formed off and worked some oil back into the chain. After awhile the bike was starting to free up and could be ridden again! Everything that could have rusted, the chain, rear cogs, and the springs inside the SPD pedals. Inside the food van today, we went to two grocery stores, Applebee’s (appetizers) and then Chipotle (they gave us twenty-four burritos!). Dropping off the food at lunch, I was in so much pain. I had never had a headache this bad. I was slurring my words and was totally debilitated. I was laying in the gravel unable to function. Worrying about my safety, my teammate, Ellie, recognized my duress and made sure I was taken to the hospital.

    <p>I was put on a strong painkiller and the pain was greatly reduced. I was back to my previous self. As we waited for the IV drip to finish, we were following the GroupMe and a frightening message came across. One of the ride directors told everyone to immediately stop biking and get off the road. The other two riders who had taken me to the hospital were called away to shuttle riders the rest of the day, but Ellie stayed. We had no idea what was going on. We speculated what we thought happened, but we were nowhere close to what actually happened. We couldn't imagine and didn't want to think what would have caused everyone to stop riding so suddenly.</p>
    <p>When Ilana arrived at the hospital to check me out, we still had no idea. One of the riders had reached out to friends on another team and heard the news. A rider on Team Portland had been struck by a driver and died. A second rider was in the Emergency Room for additional injuries.</p>
    <p>So far from the Portland team all of our hearts went out to them.

    <h1>My Final Day</h1>
    <h5>Day 14 - Sandusky, OH Service Day</h5>
    <p>After what happened, the Ulman Cancer Fund sent an employee to be with each team along with a pastor for additional support. The pastor and Laura (from Ulman) gave a really touching and heartfelt talk and really helped everyone deal with what happened. Afterward we had some time to reflect and talk privately with either person if we wished.</p>
    <p>All 4K events and rides were canceled for the next 24 hours. In honor of Jamie, we took the plans for the plans to ride roller coasters at Cedar Point and postponed our plans. Instead we stayed together as a team and went into the local town. We had lunch all together and then explored the water. A pair of swings with a commanding view of the water was normally part of a bar, but being the middle of the day the whole place was open, but empty. We relaxed for a while and talking and swinging to enjoy my last bit of time before heading home. Three people went to get tattoos. Others went to fix somewhat too nuanced haircuts.</p>
    <p>As the time approached for me to head to my flight home, we had a very sad goodbye. Waiting for the rest of the group as we got split up, we drudgingly headed back to Laura's car only to find it surprisingly blocked in? The only car blocked in, we were stuck with only a little bit of time left for our flight. The car's owner emerged, moved the car and we were back on our way, still missing the opportunity to say goodbye, but at the last moment a herd of 4K riders emerged over the horizon. Rushing up to the window, I said goodbye to each rider and finally was pulled away to make my flight.</p>
    <p>With my duffel checked and my electronic boarding ticket ready, I made my way to head of the B boarding line. The flight went by so quickly. I was awake for a little bit staring out the window as the earth flew by beneath us. Although not visible in the photograph, there was a stunning array of wind turbines along the ridgeline that just dotted the horizon. The setting sun framed the trip home as I drifted off to sleep. My mom flew home early from my cousin's wedding to meet me at the airport and to my surprise, my girlfriend, Alex, also showed up to help make sure I got a warm welcome home!</p>
    <p>I slept straight until 1 pm the next day. I needed the time to rest.</p>

    <h1>Resting and Recovery</h1>
    <h5>Day 15 to 30 - to Baltimore, MD </h5>
    <p>Being home was all about resting, but I couldn't help but feel guilt, anger, and frustration. For all my effort into training and attempting to figure out the headaches prior to the trip, we had been wrong. What we thought were migraines weren't and that misstep cost me much of the 4K ride and deeply impacted my training and caused short term brain damage.</p>
    <p>As I quickly found out over the next few days and into the first week, I was sleeping nine - twelve hours a night and barely had more energy to watch TV or lay down and listen to music. My headaches hadn't subsided and I was more tired then I've ever been. Working on a computer to type up my blog or catch up on Hulu made my headache much worse, so I stuck to watching TV on the TV from a further distance or reading. As the first few days turned into a week and then into two weeks I could feel myself recuperating. I was starting to sleep less although the hours progressed into weirder times. I would now sleep from midnight until 6 am or from 10 pm until 1 am. Some nights I would lie in bed until 4:30 am or later. But overall I was spending a larger proportion of each day reading or being active. I was cooking for myself and chewing through about a 400-page book each day. I was keeping up on the World Cup and cheering the US team onto victory.</p>

    <h1>Bouncing Back</h1>
    <h5>Day 31 to 45 - Baltimore, MD</h5>
    <p>Today was the start. Day 1 of my return. Hopping on the stationary bike I pedaled and pedaled and pedaled. Ding! Done. 15 minutes. At least it was a start.</p>
    <p>After seeing Dr. Crutchfield last week, he made a big discovery that had been overlooked by my previous physician. All of my headache issues over the past seven months were due to an inflamed occipital nerve. The symptoms were similar to migraines, but the nerve explained everything and the best part was that it could be cured in a very short time frame now that it was identified. This 15 minute bike ride was a huge improvement as I couldn’t bike ten minutes just a few days earlier on the previous Friday. With the proper medication one of my problems was being solved. Now the rest will take time as my brain recovers from the impact. For the first time in weeks, I would go almost a whole day without having a headache.</p>
    <p>One of the parts of parts of properly healing was to cut back on straining the nerve more. So I am limited to only "walking, walking in waist deep water and stationary biking," I chose to bike as long as I could. Working up from only 15 minutes on July 1st of continuous riding to a full hour and half within the first week of July. It has been hard to get motivated to keep riding, but having the Mio heart rate monitor has helped to track my output and have some motivation while on a stationary bike.</p>
    <p>I am just so eager to get back to biking. I can’t believe how much I miss running and more than anything, mountain biking:</p>
