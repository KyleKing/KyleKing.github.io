	h4.cd Summary
	p.cd Quick and efficient disease diagnostics require percision, innovation, and ingenuity. Current diagnostic tests are often performed by lab technicians and can take 24 to 48 hours to heed results. Accurate results can influence treatment plans and avoid unnecessary follow up appointments. As an undergraduate researcher in the MML, I am developing technology that simplifies the diagnostic process. The final product is a tool that can be integrated into a sample preparation device to be used by a variety of audiences including primary care physicians and doctors in developing countries.

	h4.cd The Technology
	p.cd Rather than waiting for an analyte sample to interact with an activated surface, our solution involves an efficient matrix of activated low melting point (LMP) agarose beads. The large surface area results in little to no delays in diffusion time, allowing for rapid binding reactions and the identification of small concentrations of analyte. Quantifying the amount of analyte requires a specific technique to overcome the opaque nature of the capture matrix. LMP agarose beads can be melted by an external heater to create a solid and transparent mass, overcoming light scatter and limited optical detection caused by silicon beads, monoliths, and agarose.

	h4.cd Challenges
	ul
		li Quickly assess the validity of our assumption that melting agarose beads is feasible and has an optical improvement
		li Determine an effective chemical reaction to activate the agarose surface and detect the target analyte
		li Create ~30 µm diameter LMP agarose beads in large quantities without clogging and with high consistency in size distribution (i.e. avoid the beads coalescing and combining with each other)
		li Demonstrate the assay in a sample end device

	h4.cd Progress
	p.cd This an ongoing project that I have the opportunity of working on through spring 2016 thanks to the University of Maryland SEEDS fellowship program and the Maryland Technology ASPIRE grant.

	h5.cd Conducting a "Sanity Check"
	p.cd Using a macro-scale experiment, I showed that melting beads inside a chip is feasible within our temperature constraints (the water inside the chip can't boil) and that an optical improvement was noticeable.

	h5.cd Selecting the Chemical Reaction
	p.cd Developing a chemical interaction was likewise difficult. I needed a reaction that is temperature stable under 100℃ and that would be easily hybridized onto agarose, a typically inert surface. I researched and found a ____ paper (citation) that I replicated in lab with a demonstrated experiment inside a custom ___ well plate.

	h5.cd Producing Agarose Beads
	p.cd To produce beads at my ideal size scale, I've designed a coflow droplet generator. By flowing in an immiscible fluid, silicone oil alongside agarose..[need better explanation].. Below is a video of one my droplet generators in action:

	p.cd The size of the droplets can be controlled by varying the flow rate and changing the dimensions of the channel. We originally worked with PDMS, but settled on PMMA as the material would perform better under the high pressure of agarose droplet generation. The largest challenge came from integrating agarose, as it is very temperature sensitive. I attempted to design a pressure driven flow that would allow me to heat and mix the dead volume inside a container. Other solutions included using vacuum pressure to reduce the amount of dead volume and operating the chip on top of a hot plate. Ultimately we discovered a much more elegant solution by conducting failure analysis.
	p.cd The first problem to overcome was maintaining the temperature of the syringe without heating the expensive syringe pump. Using felt, electrical tape, tin foil, and heat tape, I designed a reusable and insulated design that would maintain a constant temperature of 60℃ inside the syringe (pictured below). If the agarose became too cold the viscosity would increase causing the chip to rupture under the additional pressure and stress. Adding an additional tweak to maintain the temperature onto the chip, I wrapped the tubing from the agarose syringe to the chip in heat shrink tubing for additional insulation (red wrap pictured in later images).

	p.cd The second problem to overcome was both heating and cooling the chip. When the beads were separating they needed to be heated to maintain a low viscosity and create regularly sized beads. To accomplish this, I designed a PID controller based on the raspberry pi that could control two independent peltier tiles and associated heat sinks. To ensure tight contact between the fan, heat sink, peltier tile, chip, and droplet collector I additionally designed a laser cut and 3D printed enclosure nicknamed the "Turtle Bot" (pictured below).

	h5.cd Next Steps
	p.cd In the next few months, I will be working on an integrated demo that combines my progress with bead production and chemical diagnostic experiments inside a COC chip. Once completed, I hope to publish a paper and discuss the advantages of this approach for microfluidic diagnostics.
