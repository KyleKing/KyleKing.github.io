# Boy Scouts

## Summary

I was late to join Cub Scouts, but after seeing a presentation in lunch one day, I remember being excited to try archery and join. I caught up in rank and earned the arrow of light then transitioned to Boy Scouts starting in sixth grade. As a Boy Scout I learned numerous outdoor skills, leadership skills, and many life lessons. As a scout, we were evacuated due to a flash flood then spent the night in a firehouse and spent a week on an island in the Florida Keys. I completed my Eagle Project in the Spring of 2010. :::

## Eagle Scout Project

The Eagle Scout project is an opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills and implement a project to help your community. For the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, I led a project to build fire hose enrichment items for the Chimpanzees and Elephants. I reached out local firehouses and hardware companies for donations then recruited most of my scout troop and available parents. Working most of a Saturday, we completed three hammocks and two balls for the Maryland Zoo.
