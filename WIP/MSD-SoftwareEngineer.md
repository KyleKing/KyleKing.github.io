# Meso Scale Diagnostics

## Software Engineer II

As a Software Engineer II at MesoScale Diagnostics, I have demonstrated my technical knowledge and initiative on numerous projects.

- Technical lead for three ongoing and any future software projects for the Engineering department.
- Created and maintained product and engineering road maps to foster coordination with other departments.
- Led initiative to modernize internal processes with tooling for CI/CD, VCS, and private package index.
- Designed a data ingestion and visualization framework in Python using pipeline and layered architectures and ported two legacy dashboards to the framework to demonstrate the improved performance and configurability.
- Proposed architectural improvements and built proof of concept to decouple a monolithic codebase.
- Hired a junior employee and fostered that employee's growth by assigning projects and providing feedback.

## Systems Engineer I

As a Systems Engineer I at MesoScale Diagnostics, I have worked on every part of an instrument's life cycle. From prototype systems under development to implementing improvements to instruments in the field.

- Led engineering development of a Python software for instrument assembly and repair from initial design and requirements specification to verification and release. Iterated over user feedback and released on schedule.
- Implemented a Python tool to automate customer upgrades for major changes in new company software.
- Prepared and merged over a hundred code reviews with approval by senior engineers.
- Built, improved, and maintained internal dashboards to visualize incoming parts inspection data and to calculate downtime and performance characteristics of automated systems.
- Analyzed CCD camera images to prototype a numeric model that corrected for camera ghosting.
- Investigated instrument alignment errors then designed and released a software tool to apply the correction.
- Integrated a REST API into legacy software and found solutions to support offline use cases.
- Developed control code and fabricated prototype components for robotic sample preparation and pipetting systems.
- Designed a modular Python packaging ecosystem to meet automated motion control and analysis needs.
