I think that on a large desktop screen, it seems weird that the text stretches all the way across. Maybe you should go for a multi-column approach on larger screens? I think all of that would work, probably with some kind of summary at the top, maybe with links to repos/other info before going into a more descriptive summary


Yeah, I started writing some of the content and its way too long. I think I'm going to try to keep it to bullets or an outline format and focus more on linking to the content if people are interested
