Gulp-GH-Pages-Boilerplate
=========================

Gulp for integration with Github Pages, SCSS, Coffee, and Jade. Outputs files that can be hosted by Github at a custom domain name without Jekyll

## How to Run

1. Run `npm install` to get the list of necessary dev-dependencies
2. Run gulp locally: `./node_modules/.bin/gulp`
3. Some gulp-dependencies may be out of date, so please update the package.json file as needed
