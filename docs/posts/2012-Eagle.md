# Boy Scouts

## Summary

As a Boy Scout, I learned numerous outdoor skills, leadership skills, and many life lessons. In 2006, we were camping on the [Treasure Island Scout Reservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Island_Scout_Reservation) when an upstream dam was at risk of failure and opened the dam to release pressure. The local EMS evacuated us from the island and we slept on folding chairs in the Firehouse until we returned home in the morning. We sold mulch to self-fund our one high adventure trip to the Florida Keys Sea Base where we camped in hammocks by the beach and saw multiple sharks. I completed my Eagle Project in the Spring of 2010.

## Eagle Scout Project

The Eagle Scout project is an opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills and implement a project to help your community. For the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore, I led a project to build fire hose enrichment items for the Chimpanzees and Elephants. I reached out local firehouses and hardware companies for donations then recruited most of my scout troop and available parents. Working most of a Saturday, we completed three hammocks and two balls for the Maryland Zoo.
