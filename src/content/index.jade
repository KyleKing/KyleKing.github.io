            h6 BIOE371: Bioengineering Math and Statistics
            p A MATLAB-heavy course, we were challenged to design and solve problems using differential equations, linear algebra and statistics to model feedback systems in biology.
            h6 BIOE489D: Biological Datamining
            p I chose this elective to learn more about the implications of genomic information to medical device and drug development. The class further developed my skill set using the string analysis toolbox of Matlab.
            h6 EDCP318T: Applied Contextual Leadership; Venture Leadership
            p This class challenged me to better understand myself in order to lead others. We worked as a class through three outdoor expeditions to build stronger communication, peer awareness, and leadership skills in order to prepare for employment as a Adventure Program Trip Leader.
            h6 BIOE241: Biocomputational Methods
            p This class was my first introduction to the application of computer technology to solve problems. I became proficient in Matlab and C along with building a better understanding of positional numerical systems.
