# Canon US Life Sciences

## Summary

The Canon US Life Sciences internship program pairs an intern with a mentor to focus on unique projects that generate new intellectual property. For my project over the summer of 2015, I prototyped a novel technique to concentrate large sample volumes within a microfluidic consumable. One of the main issues with microfluidic technology is the reliance on small sample volumes which may not be representative of the patient's system. When a biomarker occurs only in low concentrations, a small sample volume has the statistical potential to emit or concentrate the target biomarker leading to an incorrect diagnosis. The concept device concentrates large samples up to 1 ml into small volumes that are optimal for microfluidic processing. Canon is currently protecting the technology as a trade secret during development with plans of patenting the technology.

## Experience

- Designed and automated a prototype mechatronic system
- Conducted data analysis and developed image processing routines with MATLAB
- Designed components in SolidWorks and underwent design reviews before sending drawings out to a 3rd party supplier
- Utilized a full machine shop, laser cutter, Roland CNC milling machine, and Formlabs SLA printer to quickly iterate over multiple prototypes
- Conducted market research including review of 510(K) submissions
- Filed an internal invention disclosure
