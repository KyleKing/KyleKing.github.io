The Chipotle Fundraiser was from 6-9 pm on Monday March 3rd at the College Park Chipotle located near South Campus.

Bike Delivering was a totally different story...

So the weather outside was dismal, snowy, icy, and about as bad as Maryland weaher gets (only to climb back up to be sunny and 50's on Saturday). School was closed (we would get a delay the next day too!), despite the best efforts the very dedicated UMD ground crew who were already shoveling snow, as it fell, as early as 3 am.

At this point, we were starting to question the safety/sanity fo bike delivering in this weather. With no chance of rescheduling, we decided we had to make the most of today. In the morning, Jackie and I biked over to put up flyers throughout South Campus and to test out on the bikes on the sloppy streets.

It couldn't have been more fun.

The snow and ice made for a super GNARLY roadway, perfect for drifting and spinning out on.

In other words, thank goodness my mom doesn't read this blog or should would have been so worried about us. I even ended up slipping into a puddle while falling down stairs, but thankfully didn't crash on the bike.

Now the logistics of the delivery were way trickier than anyone anticipated, well maybe not everyone. When I first dreamed up the idea to bike deliver. I imagined we would only have about 10-20 deliveries and I could stay in line to pick up 5 people's burritos at a time. Instead, we had 50 orders added the morning-of to bring our total to about 72. With a couple cancelation and a few last minute orders, it ended up being 70 burritos, weighing in at an estimated 108 lbs. (that is, one chipotle burrito is about one sixth of a standard newbron, so 1.5 lb/burrito times 70 burritos = 108 lb!). Yikes.

7 pm. It hadn't hit me yet, but there was no way my original plan would work. Jackie, Yi, and Louis were helping to order and begin getting the burriots, but it wasn't until Yi's intevention with a brilliantly timed idea that we were on track to make the deliveries. Although this meant we no longer would be able to bike deliver, we could barely fit the six boxes of burritos into the trunk.

10 pm. Avoiding an instant cancellation of my credit card (Apparently my security settings are too good) we purchased all $400+ of burritos and stuffed them into the trunk to head over to the North Campus communities. We arrived at Denton first and left two brave volunteers with the stacks of burritos, while the rest of us stayed with the vehicle to deliver to the Ellicott community.

With a quick post to the FB group to let everyone know we had arrived, a horde of students exited Laplata to get their burritos. Within a few minutes most of the burritos were delivered and any errors had been figured out. We left heading over to the Courtyards complex, off to the Varsity and then split up for the night. Louis and I were dropped off back with the bikes and biked around campus to deliver the first two burritos by bike for the night #bikeChipotle. While Yi and Jackie dropped off the last few along the south-side of campus.

THANK YOU to everyone who came out and supported this fundraiser along with everyone who helped with the bike delivery at some point. I specifically want to thank the majestic Yi who donated her driving prowess and poor vehicle and the three musketeers: Elizabeth Prinkey, Louis Levine, and Jackie Weiss (for lack of a better sounding three person team) who hung in until the very end to make sure everyone who ordered received their burrito.

Above, finally time to eat dinner!

And look to the right for....

THE LAST TWO BURRITOS!!!

To be delivered tomorrow, good night UMD.
