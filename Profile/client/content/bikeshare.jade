	h4.cd Summary
	p.cd At the University of Maryland, I am actively working with 13 undergraduate students to build a stationless bikeshare system as part of a four year honors research program. I am the full stack web developer of our website and have contributed to other facets of the project including sensor selection, smart-lock design, and to help with rapid prototyping.

	h4.cd The Technology
	p.cd To use our system, a user can load our website and look for the nearest available bike. To reserve the bike, the user only has to tap the icon and will receive a success message confirming the reservation. When the user arrive at the bike rack, they can tap any available bike with their RedBars NFC card. Their encrypted ID is then sent to the database to request access. The website recognizes the user and clears their reservation, while returning a code to unlock the bike. Using a small linear actuator, the locking pin is released, so the user may now ride the bike. When done with their ride, the user can return their bike to any rack on campus. When the user locks the bike the electronics send a ping to the website and confirm the new location and the successful locking event. Both messages from the bike-mounted smart lock to the website are sent over a distributed Zigbee routing system and collected by a raspberry pi to be sent to the database.

	h4.cd Progress
	h5.cd Self-Taught Web Development
	p.cd I built my first website in December of 2013 with static HTML and CSS files. A few months later, I began teaching myself more advanced website development with the goal of solving one of our leading issues, inventory management and system coordination. I researched many different frameworks, such as Node/MEAN, Firebase, Native iOS, and more, but selected Meteor for its cross-platform support, optimistic user interface, and growing package library. I was equally excited to be part of a up and coming platform and contribute to an equally growing community.
	h1.cd Much of what I learned was from a variety of resources including the Meteor documentation, exploring with the web inspector, stack overflow, and many blog posts.

	h5.cd Real Time Mapping
	p.cd To quickly iterate and develop my skills, I set my first priority to build a real time map. Having a map will be crucial to the core function of the website, as most of the data will be geographic coordinates. I tapped into the Meteor's '.observe' query to fire events on database updates. Take a look at the code behind the application and a demo of the functionality.

	h1.cd Map DEMO (TBD)
	//- #map
	.cd
		+bikeshare_map

	//- p.cd The next challenge was to optimize the database structure and reduce the load time for an anticipated 80-100 bikes for a complete bikeshare. Additionally, I knew that we would have two updates per bike ride with an estimated 10 rides per day.

	h5.cd Iterate over user feedback
	p.cd We ran a focus group midway through our development to receive feedback on our business model, website, and lock design. We received feedback on all aspects of our project that helped guide our development

	the website's development and I have received constant feedback from friends, coworkers, and classmates on the design, operation, and look of the website. I have released three major user interface overhauls and removed many navigational pages to simplify the entire experience.



	p.cd A new feature that we hadn't considered was the reserve feature. From roughly 20 customer interviews we conducted, the reserve feature was mentioned in some way with positive feedback, so I moved forward with developing the extension to our database. Additionally on the map page, we received feedback on locating the user, but this feedback turned out to be much more complex. Some users preferred to find their own position on the map, while a majority preferred to have the map automatically locate them each time. To build a workaround, I added a toggle button to turn on/off the location feature and the ability to remember this state for each user. Learning from users has proved highly effective and an excellent experience while still a student.

	h5.cd Begin Integrating Security features
	p.cd Securing the user information has always been a priority and one that I picked up early when starting developing with Meteor. Luckily user accounts and roles are very easy to create within the Meteor ecosystem. ....

	h5.cd Systems Integration and Multi-Disciplinary Contributions

	p.cd Arduino - Zigbee → (XBee Protocol) ← Zigbee - raspberry pi → (DDP) ← Meteor Database
	p.cd One of the most interesting components of this website was the challenge of integrating a communication network with real time updates to the website's database. I solved this by building a minimalistic Node.JS application that communicates over Meteor's default Distributed Document Protocol (DDP). The Node application is run on an equally minimalist raspberry pi, which collects information over serial directly from a XBee module (our communications network). Through this process we can allow for two way communication and allow for a high throughput of information from our end-IOT devices.


	p.cd All of this hard work has paid off in the progress I've made towards building
		a(href="https://redbarbikes.com") redbarbikes.com
		| . The website includes several functions including login roles, real time maps, an admin panel with charts and tables, and many more. I've learned how to use Meteor-Up and host the website behind an SSL certificate on one Digital Ocean's servers.

	h5.cd Next Steps
	p.cd As of November 15th, we have exactly five months left to finish our Thesis paper and complete each of our subteam's goals. For me this means that I will need to finish the general user interface, fix the last few bugs, integrate tests to make sure the demo day proceeds smoothly, and a whole litany of features.
