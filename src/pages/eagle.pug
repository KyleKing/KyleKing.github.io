        h4.cd Summary
        p.cd I was late to join Cub Scouts, but after seeing a presentation in lunch one day, I remember being excited to try archery and join. I caught up in rank and earned the arrow of light then transitioned to Boy Scouts starting in sixth grade. As a Boy Scout I learned numerous outdoor skills, leadership skills, and many life lessons. As a scout, we were evacuated due to a flash flood then spent the night in a firehouse and spent a week on an island in the Florida Keys. I completed my Eagle Project in the Spring of 2010.

    h4.cd Eagle Scout Project
    p.cd The Eagle Scout project is an opportunity to demonstrate leadership skills and implement a project to help your community. I wanted to find a project to benefit the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore and decided to build Firehose enrichment items. Securing the necessary supplies, I reached out firehouses and hardware companies for donations. I recruited most of my scout troop and available parents and working most of a Saturday, we completed 3 hammocks and 2 balls for the Chimpanzees and Elephants at the Maryland Zoo.
