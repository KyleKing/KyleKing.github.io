		h4.cd Summary
		p.cd I really enjoy making things and 3D printing and rapid prototyping are really powerful tools. At the University of Maryland, I had access to the largest Makerbot Innovation center filled with 5th generation Makerbot Replicators, laser cutting, milling, and many other options. I've made things from a replacement stand for my lamp, a mount for a bike light, to a bike 4th hand tool, my&nbsp;

	h4.cd My Highlighted 3D Prints

	p.cd Improved Lamp Base: The cover photo of this section is of my IKEA lamp base, which shattered in half. I 3D printed a fixed version and still continue to use it over two years later:

	p.cd Bike Light Adapter: I needed a way to mount my bike light on my bike rack to make commuting safer. I quickly 3D printed a glow in the dark mount that came out perfectly the first time!

	p.cd Solder sucker: This is probably one of my favorite prints because I picked a radius to match the 0.1 mm layer height profile and the curvature came out so cleanly. The print mounts onto a leftover fan (used in a freshman year hovercraft project) and attaches to a ventilation hose, which all guides to a carbon filter. An attached Arduino controller modulates the fan and the amount of air flow
