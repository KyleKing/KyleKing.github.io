        h4.cd Summary
        p.cd Over the summer of 2014, I joined a team of 25 riders who biked across the country with 4K for Cancer. I served as the team mechanic and fixed everything from a melted brake cable (Day 1) to a number of broken nipples (Day 3+). With very generous support and two successful fundraisers, I raised $5,450 for The Ulman Cancer Fund (UCF) for Young Adults.

    h4.cd Chipotle Fundraiser
    p.cd In March, a fellow rider, Jackie, and I planned a Chipotle fundraiser where a portion of each purchase would go to UCF. To help drive interest in the fundraiser, we offered to bike deliver some of the Burritos. However, the night before the fundraiser, there was a major snow storm that canceled classes the following day. With the help of generous friends, we persevered and delivered 72 orders all across campus. At the end of the day Jackie and I had raised over $900.

    p.cd Unfortunately, I was involved in a crash and sustained a concussion shortly before reaching Niagra Falls. I eventually had to fly home, but was still able to join the team in Seattle. While only on the trip for 14 days, the trip was amazing and an incredible experience.
